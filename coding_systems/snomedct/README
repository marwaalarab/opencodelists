SNOMED CT
---------

https://www.snomed.org/

SNOMED CT aims to be the "global common language for clinical terms".

There is an interantional release, and various national releases.

New releases are published irregularly -- there was a schedule, but it's been disrupted
by covid.

We obtain the raw data from TRUD [0], and from this we import:

* the International release
* the UK edition
* the UK Clinical Extension

You will need an account to access TRUD, and may be asked for a reason when you sign up -- if so, mention OpenCodelists.

On the TRUD release page, download the latest release, which will be a zip file called something like uk_sct2cl_32.10.0_20220216000001Z.zip (do not unzip).

To import the data, run:
    ./manage.py import_data coding_systems.snomedct path/to/zip/file/
    --release <release_name> --valid-from YYYYMMDD --import-ref <ref>

- `release` is a short label for this coding system release - the official version number/reference if there is one.
- `valid-from` is the date that this release is valid from (NOT the date it is being
  imported into OpenCodelists), in YYYYMMDD format
- `import-ref` is an optional long-form reference field for any other potential
  references or comments on this import if desired, e.g. full filenames
