BNF
---

BNF codes are used to identify anything that is prescribed in England (and maybe elsewhere).

For more details, see our most popular blog post [0].

We obtain the raw data from the BSA [1].  New releases are published annually, sometimes
with unannounced mid-year updates.

Download the latest release, which will be a zipfile named something like `20220701_1656687539491_BNF_Code_Information.zip`

To import the data, run:

    ./manage.py import_data coding_systems.bnf path/to/zip/file
    --release <release_name> --valid-from YYYYMMDD --import-ref <ref>

- `release` is a short label for this coding system release - the official version number/reference if there is one.
- `valid-from` is the date that this release is valid from (NOT the date it is being
  imported into OpenCodelists), in YYYYMMDD format
- `import-ref` is an optional long-form reference field for any other potential
  references or comments on this import if desired, e.g. full filenames
