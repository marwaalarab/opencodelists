Dictionary of Medicines and Devices (dm+d)
------------------------------------------

dm+d codes are used to identify medicines and devices in use across the NHS.

For more details, see our blog post [0].

We obtain the raw data from TRUD [1].

You will need an account to access TRUD, and may be asked for a reason when you sign up -- if so, mention OpenCodelists.

On the TRUD release page, download the latest release, which will be a zip file called something like nhsbsa_dmd_4.0.0_20220404000001.zip

To import the data, run:

    ./manage.py import_data coding_systems.dmd path/to/zip/file
    --release <release_name> --valid-from YYYYMMDD --import-ref <ref>

- `release` is a short label for this coding system release - the official version number/reference if there is one.
- `valid-from` is the date that this release is valid from (NOT the date it is being
  imported into OpenCodelists), in YYYYMMDD format
- `import-ref` is an optional long-form reference field for any other potential
  references or comments on this import if desired, e.g. full filenames
