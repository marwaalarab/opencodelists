CTV3
----

CTV3 is a retired system of clinical terms.

It is the successor to Read v2, and is replaced by SNOMED CT.  (The "CT" stands for
"Clinical Terms" in both CTV3 and SNOMED CT.)

No new CTV3 codes are published, although sometimes TPP have published new "Y codes", which look like CTV3 codes.

The last release of CTV3 was on 1st Aug 2018.  This data is no longer available to
download online, but can be retrieved from the zip file on dokku1: `nhs_readctv3_25.0.0_20180401000001.zip`.

CTV3 codes from TPP are extracted from the database by running all the jobs in
[this workspace](https://jobs.opensafely.org/datalab/opensafely-testing/tpp-ctv3-codes/), and
following the [usual process for checking and releasing output files](https://docs.opensafely.org/releasing-files/).  The two output files required for importing data into OpenCodelists are named:

- `ctv3_dictionary.csv.gz`
- `ctv3_hierarchy.csv.gz`

To import the data, copy the CTV3 zip file to the same folder as the TPP-extracted csv.gz files, and run:

    ./manage.py import_data coding_systems.ctv3 path/to/dir/
    --release <release_name> --valid-from YYYYMMDD --import-ref <ref>

- `release` is a short label for this coding system release - the official version number/reference if there is one.
- `valid-from` is the date that this release is valid from (NOT the date it is being imported into OpenCodelists), in YYYYMMDD format
- `import-ref` is an optional long-form reference field for any other potential
  references or comments on this import if desired, e.g. full filenames
